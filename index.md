# Where Is My Mind?

This are my reflections about where I and we might go, what happens, what interests me. I dont think I am smarter than anyone. I do believe however, that in times like these not speaking up is showing compliance. This is my attempt to formulate my thoughts.

# All systems: GO!

I believe in positivity, positivism, rationality, human rights, equality, privacy, freedom, solidarity, sustainability and the right to a personal pursuit of happiness.

# My writing (more at /about)

 This page is primarily a freewritten notepad of my thoughts. Thinking "straight" is difficult for my brain. This siteÂ´s tree structure helps me to build up my diferrent train of thoughts and ultimately calm my brain. So firstly this is in a raw "beta" form mostly for myself. However, at some point I will probably make this public if I gathered enough thoughts that seem worthwhile. I should also rewrite those thoughts to make them more readable. Lets see if I will do this. Writing with purpose is/was one of my biggest weaknesses and very hard for me. Freewriting is exactly the opposite. I can recommend it to anyone.
