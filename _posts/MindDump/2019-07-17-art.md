# Is this Art?

or

# Form and Function

## Good music

I used to be proud about my taste in music. Passionate might be the better word. When people asked me what music I listen to I would always answer: "Good music". Beside my obvious self-indulgence, this statement still rings true to my ears. I can recognize music really quickly and can feel for myself quickly thereafter if I find it good. I could never really put my finger on what exactly makes music "good" for me.

In short I think Good music makes me feel something and I can hear that somebody actually made it. It lets my mind wander into it. I also realized that I can sing along to many of my favorite songs, but I could not tell you what they are about. Lyrics and vocals are just another instrument for my brain.
Now, electronic music mastered the art of synthetically stimulating "brain waves" to induce a somewhat hypnotic state. I would guess that certain drugs work in conjunction with certain electronic music to enhance this effect. Since I don't take those drugs, and since this music is for whatever reason not on my wavelength i only experienced this hypnotic edm induced state once or twice.
"Good", "real" music on the other hand had the chance to reach me, even without any supplements. What exactly it is that reaches me I cant really tell. I know i like crescendos, melodies and beats. Maybe Ill go deeper on this some other time.

## "Art"

So, what exactly is "Art". I definitely cant come up with a general definition. I used to think I´m not really into Art. I used to think of art as mostly paintings, theater, literature, classical music. That kind of stuff. All the "popular" Art were pieces of entertainment rather than art to me. Those traditional high-brow kinds of art don´t really reach me. I don´t get them. They mostly don´t make me feel anything. I can recognize the craft, the difficulty in making it. However, some exceptions (e.g. Caspar David Friedrich) ![Wanderer above the sea](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg) aside, they don´t transport me somewhere. I even discovered I am more fascinated by people explaining the beauty of a certain art piece (e.g. [Nerdwriter1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j5pUtRcNX4)), than the piece itself.  

For me the traditional definition of art - that I had in my head - does not fit with the times anymore. Looking back we can see how the understanding of "Art" changed over the centuries and it is always easier to see the changes of the past, than the Umwälzungen of the now. That doesn´t mean all the "high-brow" art becomes obsolete. That never happened. New styles are just added on top.

## What moves me?

Art. Everything made by somebody that moves me is Art to me. Everything helping me to turn off my brain for a while, helping me to maybe only focus on it and not those thousand distractions in my brain is Entertainment. If it does both, its super-art I guess. Best of both worlds.

## Form over function? Function over Form?

Form over function is what apple popularized. Jobs and his people came up with the form they wanted to end up with and made the engineers build a device that fits into this form. As a rational nerd, this seems odd. On first thought I would always design with function in mind first. It just makes more sense. And in some cases I even find results of this philosophy "beautiful", like mechanical keyboards, space vehicles ...
I do have to admit that most often form over function returns "prettier" results.
In this case, the highest form of the craft, of making or design with the highest chance of producing art is: **Function and Form**.

True art implements the necessities of the function, conveys true meaning, meaningfulness, educates, is interesting while at the same time conforms to a beautiful form to its intended senses.

And finally, may I present to you..

The mailbag.
