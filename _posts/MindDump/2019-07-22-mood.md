# External Mood Influences: EMI

I don't think I will write a lot today. But I found out something crazy today:
However my day went - what I listened to on a podcast, how successful or unsuccessful I was at work, how anxious a call was I had to make.. It all affects my mood. I never really experienced this direct effect before. I need to keep this in mind going forward.
